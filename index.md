Here's a link to some short (100-400 word) writing samples, hosted here on github: https://github.com/JFWalasik/ShortWritingSamples-100-400Words

Here's some Work Instructions, SOPs, and Checklists that I've written and/or edited: https://github.com/JFWalasik/WorkInstructions_SOPs_Checklists

Here's a guideline doc that I edited: https://github.com/JFWalasik/Dogfooding-Guidelines-Proofread-edited- (Note: I didn't write this doc, I just did some light editing, formatting, rebranding, and published it to a SharePoint site. All the other docs linked here were written or re-written/heavily edited by me. I've included this as an example of something I've edited, to show the type of docs that I've worked with.)

## Legal (immigration) writing

Here's a link to a post I wrote about proposed change to H-1B regulations: https://swlgpc.com/eng/dol-dhs-interim-wage-criteria/ As background, in 2020 USCIS proposed dramatic changes to the the way H-1B petitions are selected and adjudicated. The firm I worked for (SW Law Group, PC) wanted to publish a summary of these changes and notify our clients immediately. I offered to read/scan through the proposed regulations (about 300 pages) and summarize it, and I did so in a few hours. After review by two senior attroneys, we published the article the same day that the proposed regulations were issued.

Here's a sample of a redacted L-1B (specialized knowledge) petition I wrote for a tech startup: https://github.com/JFWalasik/Legal-Writing---Immigration
